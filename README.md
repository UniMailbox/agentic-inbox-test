  <h1>Agentic Inbox</h1>
  <p><em>A self-hosted email client with an AI agent, running entirely on Cloudflare Workers</em></p>
</div>

Agentic Inbox lets you send, receive, and manage emails through a modern web interface -- all powered by your own Cloudflare account. Incoming emails arrive via [Cloudflare Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/), each mailbox is isolated in its own [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) with a SQLite database, and attachments are stored in [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

An **AI-powered Email Agent** can read your inbox, search conversations, and draft replies -- built with the [Cloudflare Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) and [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/).

## How to setup

**Important**: Clicking the 'Deploy to Cloudflare' button is only one part of the setup. You must follow the **After deploying** steps as well. For a full step-by-step guide with screenshots, refer to this comment: 
https://github.com/cloudflare/agentic-inbox/issues/4#issuecomment-4269118513

### To set up

1. Deploy to Cloudflare. The deploy flow will automatically provision R2, Durable Objects, and Workers AI. You'll be prompted for **DOMAINS**, which is the domain (yourdomain.com) you want to receive emails for (email@yourdomain.com).

     [![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/agentic-inbox)

2. **Configure Cloudflare Access** -- Enable [one-click Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-10-03-one-click-access-for-workers/) on your Worker under Settings > Domains & Routes. The modal will show your `POLICY_AUD` and `TEAM_DOMAIN` values. `TEAM_DOMAIN` can be either your Access team URL or the full `.../cdn-cgi/access/certs` URL. **You must set these as secrets for your Worker.**
3. **Set up Email Routing** -- In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain > Email Routing and create a catch-all rule that forwards to this Worker
4. **Enable Email Service** -- The worker needs the `send_email` binding to send outbound emails. See [Email Service docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/send-email-workers/)
5. **Create a mailbox** -- Visit your deployed app and create a mailbox for any address on your domain (e.g. `hello@example.com`)

### Troubleshooting Access

1. If you see `Invalid or expired Access token`, that usually means `POLICY_AUD` or `TEAM_DOMAIN` secrets are incorrect.
   * Resolution: [turn Access off and back on for the Worker to get the Access modal again](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-10-03-one-click-access-for-workers/), then reset your Worker secrets to the latest `POLICY_AUD` and `TEAM_DOMAIN` values shown there.
2. If you see `Cloudflare Access must be configured in production`, this application is intentionally enforcing Cloudflare Access so your inbox is not exposed to anyone on the internet.
   * Resolution: enable Access using [one-click Cloudflare Access for Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-10-03-one-click-access-for-workers/), then set the `POLICY_AUD` and `TEAM_DOMAIN` Worker secrets from the modal values.

## Features

- **Full email client** — Send and receive emails via Cloudflare Email Routing with a rich text composer, reply/forward threading, folder organization, search, and attachments
- **Per-mailbox isolation** — Each mailbox runs in its own Durable Object with SQLite storage and R2 for attachments
- **Built-in AI agent** — Side panel with 9 email tools for reading, searching, drafting, and sending
- **Auto-draft on new email** — Agent automatically reads inbound emails and generates draft replies, always requiring explicit confirmation before sending
- **Configurable and persistent** — Custom system prompts per mailbox, persistent chat history, streaming markdown responses, and tool call visibility

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, TipTap, `@cloudflare/kumo`
- **Backend:** Hono, Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects (SQLite), R2, Email Routing
- **AI Agent:** Cloudflare Agents SDK (`AIChatAgent`), AI SDK v6, Workers AI (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`), `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`
- **Auth:** Cloudflare Access JWT validation (required outside local development)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

1. Set your domain(s) in `wrangler.jsonc` (`DOMAINS` is a comma-separated list — see [Multiple domains](#multiple-domains) below)
2. Create an R2 bucket named `agentic-inbox`: `wrangler r2 bucket create agentic-inbox`

### Multiple domains

`DOMAINS` accepts a comma-separated list of zones that have [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/) enabled. The first value is treated as the **default domain** in the UI; the others are selectable when creating a mailbox.

```jsonc
"vars": {
  "DOMAINS": "example.com,foo.com,bar.com",
  "EMAIL_ADDRESSES": []
}
```

Operational notes:

- **One Worker, many zones.** Cloudflare Email Routing only delivers mail for the zone on which the catch-all rule is configured. You must add a catch-all rule (`*@example.com → Worker`, `*@foo.com → Worker`, etc.) in **each** zone's Email Routing dashboard, all pointing to this same Worker.
- **Default domain.** Only the first entry in `DOMAINS` is shown in the UI as the default; other entries appear in the domain picker when creating mailboxes.
- **Changing `DOMAINS` locally.** Edit `wrangler.jsonc` (or `.dev.vars` if you have one) and **restart `wrangler dev`** — `vars` are loaded at boot, not hot-reloaded. The UI refetches on focus/reload after restart.
- **Inbound delivery to the right mailbox.** When a message arrives, the worker picks the **first recipient whose domain is in `DOMAINS`** (or whose address is in `EMAIL_ADDRESSES`, which takes precedence). One inbound message is delivered to exactly one mailbox; cross-domain recipients on the same message are not split into multiple mailboxes.
- **Outbound mail.** The `From` address of every outgoing email is the mailbox address itself, so the displayed sender domain is whichever domain the mailbox was created on. Make sure outbound `send_email` is enabled for every zone in the Email Service dashboard.
- **Per-domain allow-list.** When `EMAIL_ADDRESSES` is empty, mailboxes can only be created on addresses whose domain is in `DOMAINS`. With `EMAIL_ADDRESSES` set, that explicit allow-list takes precedence and `DOMAINS` still gates inbound delivery (the recipient domain must match one of the configured zones).
- **Safety net.** If neither `EMAIL_ADDRESSES` nor `DOMAINS` is configured, inbound mail is refused (logged and dropped). Configure at least one before expecting to receive anything.
- **Multi-domain ≠ multi-tenant.** All teammates who pass the shared Cloudflare Access policy can still see every mailbox. Per-mailbox permissions are not yet supported.

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with a domain
- [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/) enabled for receiving
- [Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) enabled for sending
- [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) enabled (for the agent)
- [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) configured for deployed/shared environments (required in production)

Any user who passes the shared Cloudflare Access policy can access all mailboxes in this app by design. This includes the MCP server at `/mcp` -- external AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) connected via MCP can operate on any mailbox by passing a `mailboxId` parameter. There is no per-mailbox authorization; the Cloudflare Access policy is the single trust boundary.
